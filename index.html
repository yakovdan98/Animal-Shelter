      <h3>Mellie</h3>
      <p>Mellie is a sweet, affectionate girl once she gets to know you. She loves tennis balls, yummy treats and snacks, and giving her humans all the kisses! She walks great on leash and loves long line walks in wide open sniffy, grassy areas. Though it takes some slow intros to get to know her, once you are in her circle of friends, she will be sure to let you know by showering you with love! Mellie just wants to be with her bonded people, she will go anywhere with you and will make such a wonderful companion for anyone down for adventure and also down for a cuddle session. She most likely would do best as either the only pet or with one other solid dog brother or sister, pending a meet and greet.</p>

      <h3>Borf</h3>
      <p>Borf is a sweet, sensitive pup who is so ready to find his forever home. To say he struggles in the shelter environment is an understatement - the loud noises, all the people coming and going… it’s all difficult for him. Luckily, Borf has been staying in a foster home and his fosters are pleased to share that when Borf feels safe and loved… he is the silliest, snuggliest pup!</p>

      <h3>Gonzo</h3>
      <p>
        Good boy Gonzo! Gonzo is the ultimate toy lover and is such a goofy and fun boy all around! He loves making trips to the play yard where he will happily play with toys, jump in the pool for a cool down, and even makes for a pretty good fetch partner. Once he’s gotten some energy out playing, Gonzo makes a great walking buddy, interested in exploring but always remembering to check in with his human. He also loves going to our real life rooms where he will happily ask for belly rubs from his human friends (he has the softest belly!!).

      <h3>Kiki</h3>
      <p>
        Kiki is just five years young and looking for a loving human to give her a second chance at a comfy life. This lady previously lived outdoors and was a protective mama pup, but was also sweet and playful when around people she was comfortable with. Since arriving at the shelter(in October of 2020), we had been taking it slow to get to know Kiki – and that’s just what she’s been looking for! She now has quite the volunteer fan base!
